Our Challenges

1) We need to erstablish a connection between our smart plug and and website

2) We encountered two unlucky situations;
=> We damaged our arudino while soldering and waited for new arduino order
=> We spilled water on arudino and waited for new arduino order

3) We needed to improve our electric knowledge to design plugs. It was hard
